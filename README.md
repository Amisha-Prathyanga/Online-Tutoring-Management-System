## About The Project

Initially, Dakma Institute has never worked with an automated system that was specifically designed for their business. All the records about students, classes , teachers and other subject related materials were kept in a manual database. Therefore the management of the institute had a difficult time when managing the records of the institute. Also the owners of the institute had to increase the labor force of the institute in order to manage the manual work. With the corona pandemic and the economic crisis in the country, these problems became much worse and the ownership the institute had to rely on an online platform in order to carry out the tasks. So this automated system is introduced to the institute to carry out their tasks more efficiently.

This system consists of four user levels as Admin, Staff, Teacher and Students. The functions that could be accessible to each user level is limited accordingly.  Admin can access and change anything in the system. The owner of the institute has the admin privileges and he could insert new staff members, teachers, students, classes, class schedules etc. The staff is the next prioritized user level after the admin. Staff members can insert, update classes, insert schedules, change profile details etc. But Staff cannot delete classes or insert new users to the system. Teacher user level is granted for the teachers in the system. Teachers can upload their tutorials, class links and other related details for the classes. Teachers can also update their profile details. As for the final user level, Students can view schedules, classes, enroll for classes and do necessary payments. Also students can download necessary tutorials related to their classes and upload answers.
